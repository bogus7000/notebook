### 1. For each function below, determine:
#### a. Its rank of order and write it down with the asymptotic "Big Theta" notation:
- $n\log(n) + n^{\frac{3}{2}}$
- $n^2 + n$
- $n^{\frac{1}{2}} + 4$
- $\log_2(2^n)$
- $n\log(n) + n$
- $3\log(n) + 1$

#### b. Order the above functions from the lowest to the highest rank of order (if any ranks are equal mark it with "=")

### 2. Given the following array $S$:
$0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17$

and the key = 14

#### a. Write down the sequence of values in the array $S$ that are compared with the key in the order of the binary search algorithm (version from the lecture)

#### b. What is the returned value?

### 3. Given the input array/sequence $S$:
$6, 3, 1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 7$

and the SelectionSort algorithm:

#### a. What will be the content of the array after each iteration of the external loop?

#### b. What is the total number of comparisons between the elements of $S$?

### 4. The same as in 3. for the InsertionSort algorithm

### 5. Given the sequence $S$:
$6, 3, 1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 7$

and the MergeSort algorithm working on it:

#### a. Draw the tree of sub-sequences that are merged during this work

#### b. What is the total number of comparisons between the elements of $S$?

### 6. Apply the partition function to the following array (version from the lecture):
$6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 9, 0, 4$

#### a. Show the final contents of this array

#### b. What is the returned value?

### 7. Apply the CountSort (version from the lecture) algorithm on the following array:

$2, 1, 5, 4, 2, 10, 3, 4, 2, 5, 1$

#### a. What is the final content of the helper (counts) array after the algorithm stops?

### 8. Apply RadixSort on the following sequence of 3-digit numbers:

$501, 201, 125, 521, 321, 105, 211, 325$

#### a. What is the order of this sequence after each phase of sorting?
